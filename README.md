# SWARM

*Like [boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids), but poorly programmed*

### [Live demo](https://gwigwam.github.io/SWARM/)
[![CI](https://github.com/GWigWam/SWARM/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/GWigWam/SWARM/actions)

### It's npm + TypeScript + pixi.js

To run execute `npm run build` then open `index.htm`. Or run `npm run watch` for live refreshes of the page during development.
